Rarely used device drivers have been moved to the "driver-archive" directory. Hence, they're not
automatically made asvailable if you copy this script directory from Github onto your Blocks server.
To activate such a device driver, simply move it (both the JS and TS files) from the "driver-archive"
to the "driver" directory. Any drivers located in the "driver-archive" directory will be ignored.
